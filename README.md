# Software Engineering Project

The project focuses on essential aspects of software engineering in a concise and structured manner. It covers software engineering domains and principles, concepts like development and architecture, and addresses challenges such as technical debt and design stamina. The exploration of software design principles and code smells, along with SOLID principles, low coupling, and high cohesion, enhance effective software design. The project also delves into minimum knowledge principles, inheritance vs. composition, flat data structures, design patterns, anti-patterns, and the interface segregation principle. It examines multi-level abstractions, requirements change management, software maintenance, parameter management, agile development (Agile) and extreme programming (XP), test-driven development (TDD), and behavior-driven design. Moreover, it explores problem-related discussions encompassing domains like linear algebra, physics, and anatomy, providing insights into the fascinating world of software engineering.
