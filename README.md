## Introduction

The Ray Tracing Image Renderer project is designed to create realistic 3D scene renderings using ray tracing techniques. It places a strong emphasis on software engineering principles to ensure code quality and maintainability.

## Features

- Realistic ray tracing engine for 3D scene rendering.
- Enhanced rendering quality in detailed regions using advanced techniques.
- Utilizes multithreading for fast and efficient rendering.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

IntelliJ IDEA Workspace

### Installation

To install this project, all you need to do is to clone the project to your computer

## Usage

Go to unitest-> make your own test file -> start to build your scene -> add shapes -> add camera and colors -> 
Click Run Test -> watch your astonishing image in the image directory
