#  Ray Tracing Engine: A Software Engineering Approach

We developed a ray tracing engine that produces realistic renderings of 3D scenes.
Used ASS (adaptive duper sampling) techniques to enhance rendering quality in detailed regions. 
Leveraged multithreading for fast rendering. Emphasized software engineering principles like SOLID, design patterns, and Agile development.
The project focuses on essential aspects of software engineering in a concise and structured manner. It covers software engineering domains and principles, concepts like development and architecture, and addresses challenges such as technical debt and design stamina. The exploration of software design principles and code smells. It examines multi-level abstractions, requirements change management, software maintenance, parameter management, agile development (Agile) and extreme programming (XP), test-driven development (TDD), and behavior-driven design. Moreover, it explores problem-related discussions encompassing domains like linear algebra, physics, and anatomy, providing insights into the fascinating world of software engineering.
